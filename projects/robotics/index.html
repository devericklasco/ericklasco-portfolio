    <!-- Overview Section -->
    <section class="project-overview">
      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <p><strong>Objective:</strong> The goal of this project is to develop a robotic system using the NAO robot that can recognize and translate sign language, enhancing communication for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community.</p>
      <p><strong>Current Progress:</strong> The project is in the development phase, focusing on training the initial models and integrating them with the NAO robot.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Methodology Section -->
    <section class="project-methodology">
      <h2>Methodology</h2>
      <p>The project involves several key steps, including data collection, model training, and system integration. Current efforts are focused on the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Collecting a comprehensive dataset of sign language gestures.</li>
        <li>Preprocessing the data for model training.</li>
        <li>Developing a deep learning model for gesture recognition.</li>
        <li>Integrating the model with the NAO robot for real-time translation.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Future Work Section -->
    <section class="project-future-work">
      <h2>Future Work</h2>
      <p>Future work will include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Expanding the dataset to include more gestures and variations.</li>
        <li>Improving the accuracy and speed of the gesture recognition model.</li>
        <li>Testing the system in real-world scenarios with users.</li>
        <li>Gathering feedback and making iterative improvements based on user experience.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Conclusion Section -->
    <section class="project-conclusion">
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>This project aims to bridge the communication gap for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community using AI and robotics. While it is still in progress, the initial results are promising, and we are excited to continue developing and refining the system.</p>
